Step-by-Step Instructions:

Install Visual Studio Code: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from here.
Create a Project Directory: Create a new directory on your computer for your weather app project. For example, you can name it weather-app.
Create Files: Inside the weather-app directory, create the following three files:
index.html
style.css
script.js
Copy the Code into Files:
Copy the HTML code into index.html.
Copy the CSS code into style.css.
Copy the JavaScript code into script.js.
Open Project in Visual Studio Code:
Open Visual Studio Code. Click on File -> Open Folder... and select the weather-app directory.
Open the HTML File in a Live Server: Install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code if you haven't already. You can do this by clicking on the Extensions icon on the sidebar and searching for "Live Server". Open the index.html file in Visual Studio Code. Right-click on the index.html file and select Open with Live Server. This will open your project in a web browser.
Run the Project: Your project should now be running in the browser. You can enter a city name and click the "Search" button or use your current location to get the weather data.
